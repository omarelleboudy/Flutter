# Destini, the 8th Application and 2nd Boss Challenge.

## The Goal

In this challenge, I was to build a choose your own adventure game. The knowledge gained in the previous module, Quizzler, was to be applied here. The steps to be taken were set as TODOs in the files.

The game has 3 Endings, each based on the choices made.
