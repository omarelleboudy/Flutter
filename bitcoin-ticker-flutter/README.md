# Bitcoin Ticker, 11th Application and the 3rd and final Boss Challenge.

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform. I find the Cupertino Picker cooler than the Android Dropdown menu, so I opted to just use it for both platforms.

This is crypto currency price checking app. It monitors the price in several currencies and returns the latest price of the Bitcoin, Etherium and Litecoin in the chosen currency.
