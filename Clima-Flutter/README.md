# Clima ‚òÅ, the 10th Application.



The objective of this tutorial was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. Got to look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What this app does:

It's a weather app that grabs the current location of the device or the given City name and prints out the temperature, along with a message.

The weather API that was used : https://openweathermap.org/api
